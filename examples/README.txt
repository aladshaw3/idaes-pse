IDAES examples

Many of the examples are Jupyter Notebooks (see https://jupyter.org).
There is a convenient index of them with short descriptions
in the notebook "notebook_index.ipynb". To use this, run:

	jupyter notebook notebook_index.ipynb

or open the file from the desktop with the Jupyter program.
